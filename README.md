# Podcasts

This is an attempt to create a podcast syncing tool. For now, the main requirement is to download the latest episodes for subscribed feeds, for use with syncing to a local mp3 player. I envision this in the future to be a full-fledged podcast/RSS syncing backend (like Feedly, but to point other podcast/RSS clients to). We shall see how that goes!
